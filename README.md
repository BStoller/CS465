Architecture is the process of designing and building software systems. In full-stack development, there are two main types of architecture: monolithic and microservices. Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where all the components of an application are built together and deployed as a single unit. Microservices architecture is a newer approach where an application is broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately.

A single-page application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the page as the user interacts with it. SPAs are built using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Express is a popular Node.js web framework that provides a set of features for building web applications. HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

The backend used NoSQL MongoDB database because it’s schema-less and can handle unstructured data better than SQL databases. It’s also horizontally scalable and can handle large amounts of data. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing an easy way to transfer data between them.

Refactoring code means changing existing code without changing its external behavior. Reusable UI components are UI elements that can be reused across different parts of an application. Refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiencies can lead to better performance, maintainability, and scalability of an application.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. In a full-stack application, methods refer to the HTTP methods used to interact with the server. The most common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Endpoints are the URLs that clients use to interact with the server. Security is an important aspect of full-stack development. It’s important to secure the application at all levels, including the frontend, backend, and database.

Regarding your question about reflection on this course, I’m sorry but I’m not able to answer that question as I don’t have access to your personal information or course details. However, I can tell you that full-stack development is a highly sought-after skill in today’s job market. By learning full-stack development skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, you can become a more marketable candidate in your career field.
